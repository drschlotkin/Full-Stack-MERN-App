## Set Up Back-End

To get up and running with this project, run the following commands from the API directory of the folder that contains this README file.

First, install the project's dependencies using `npm`.

```
npm install
```

Second, ensure that you have MongoDB installed globally on your system.

* Open a `Command Prompt` (on Windows) or `Terminal` (on Mac OS X) instance and run the command `mongod` (or `sudo mongod`) to start the MongoDB daemon.
* If that command failed then youâ€™ll need to install MongoDB.
